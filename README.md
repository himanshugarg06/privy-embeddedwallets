# Biconomy-Privy Integration with Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that demonstrates the integration of Biconomy for gasless transactions and Magic for user authentication. It allows you to interact with a smart contract on the Polygon Amoy test network.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   or
   yarn

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to access the application.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
